Testing for BigData Environment

These are early days for big data and we face lot many
issues going about its installation. This project
features a test of files which can make sure that configurations
are taken care of when we install the various systems of BigData ecosystem.

They make use of perl, which is a default installation in unix distros.
Perl is famous for TAP ie, Test Anything Protocol and gives way to writing 
simple tests.I have used here Test::Simple library of perl to achive the tests.
